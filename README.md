Look, some experimentation that I've done building a http content server in node.js!

I've learned a good bit since this code was written.  Some of the code in this project is already broken out into its own module, and more code will likely follow.

If I keep playing around with this, it will most likely be forming it into a light layer of glue holding together modules that I build, or want to try.
