Noddity
=======

Noddity is a blogging platform I'm building for shits and giggles!

It's not ready for public consumption yet.  Once it is, I'll totally let you know, by changing this readme to something much more exciting.

Noddity is built in node.js.  It has no interface to edit blog posts and content - the only interface is your favorite SSH client and text editor as you write posts in plaintext (with markdown).  So, you know, maybe that's cool.
